<H1>Source for Generalised Bitmap Module</H1>

<P>This document should be used in conjunction with the
main <A HREF="gbm.htm">documentation</A>.

<P>This is all portable 32 bit C code.

<P>The source has recently been compiled on
OS/2 using VisualAge C++ 3.0 (with CTC306, CTD302 and CTU304),
Win32 using Visual C++ (version 4.0, 4.2, 5.0 and 6.0),
32 bit DOS using Watcom C/C++ version (10.6 and 11.0b) + CauseWay 1.3,
AIX using xlc,
and Linux using gcc 2.7.2.3 and egcs.

<P>It should port to any modern 32 bit platform easily enough.

<H2>Platform specific customisation</H2>

<P>When you unzip the source package, you get a directory full of
platform independant source files, and a few subdirectories containing
platform dependant files.
So your first step before building should be to copy the appropriate
subdirectory into the main directory.
eg: when building OS2

<P>
<PRE>
  copy os2
  nmake
</PRE>

<P>The platform dependant files are basically just <CODE>makefile</CODE>s,
and the configuration file for the JPEG source.

<P>The UNIX <CODE>makefile</CODE> supports a variety of different UNIXes.
By default it supports Linux, but can be made to work on other UNIXes
such as AIX, HP-UX and SunOS by invoking GNU make with a macro defined.
eg: to make for HP-UX :-

<P>
<PRE>
  make HP=1
</PRE>

<P>On platforms which don't support <CODE>ifdef</CODE> etc. in their make
programs (like GNU make does), you can use my Make Pre-Processor script,
called <CODE>mpp</CODE>, to produce a suitable <CODE>makefile</CODE>.
<CODE>mpp</CODE> is just a little <CODE>awk</CODE> script which evaluates
<CODE>ifdef</CODE>s.
It is available from my home page.
eg:

<P>
<PRE>
  mpp makefile HP &gt; makefile.HP
  make -f makefile.HP
</PRE>

<!--...sJPEG support:0:-->
<H2>JPEG support</H2>

<P>To build with JPEG support, you need the Independant JPEG Groups library
version 6a installed in a directory somewhere.

<P>You then edit/check that the makefile you are using references this
directory correctly.
There is a make variable called <CODE>IJG</CODE> which must point to the
correct directory.
On UNIX, use of this directory is indicated by passing JPEG=1 to make.
On PCs, you uncomment the <CODE>IJG</CODE> definition to make it active.

<P>When building with JPEG support, the build process works by copying
a shrunk down <CODE>makefile</CODE> called <CODE>makeijgo</CODE> to
wherever the IJG 6a is installed, and also a configuration file.
It then builds the library using compiler switches suitable for
building objects which are to be a part of the main GBM library.

<P>So, to build GBM for AIX, with JPEG support, assuming that IJG points
to a suitable directory, remembering that vanilla <CODE>make</CODE> on AIX
doesn't support <CODE>ifdef</CODE> :-

<P>
<PRE>
  mpp makefile AIX JPEG &gt; makefile.AIX
  make -f makefile.AIX
</PRE>
