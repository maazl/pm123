      <li>New plug-in interface with much more flexibility to buffer handling and filter plug-ins.</li>
      <li>The new plug-in manager checks whether the PM123/plug-in pair is known to work. It can load all old plug-ins except for
        visual plug-ins through an virtualization layer.</li>
      <li>Changed the internal data structures to use always 16 bits per sample to reduce complexity of code and plug-ins.</li>
      <li>Ported resizable file dialog from PM123 1.33.</li>
      <li>Now it is possible to control the wait period in seconds when a new stream connection is requested. (Port from PM123
        1.33).</li>
      <li>Wrap around scroller.</li>
      <li>XIO123: properly handling of TCP/IP receive timeouts.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <h4>REALEQ</h4>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Realeq does no longer delay the playback and cut the last samples. It operates now as virtually zero-phase filter.</li>
      <li>Enabling/disabling the EQ does no longer cause the playback to jump.</li>
      <li>Changing the FIR order does no longer cause major glitches.</li>
      <li>The maximum FIR order is now 16384, giving very accurate results. The maximum FFT size is now 32768.</li>
      <li>The MMX and ordinary convolution is finally removed. Both are outperformed by far by the new FFT convolution. This will
        cause <em>low CPU usage</em> even with large FIR orders.</li>
      <li>Save the slider settings by value in REALEQ.INI. Now the restore do no longer depend on the last loaded file and changes
        to the loaded settings are kept after restart.</li>
      <li>Added master gain and mute controls.</li>
      <li>Added <em>group delay equalization</em>.</li>
      <li>Scale FFT plan size and FIR order with the sampling rate.</li>

        MP3 itself.</li>
      <li>Should not crash on corrupted Xing VBR headers anymore.</li>
      <li>Read ahead buffer thread now runs at critical priority, so no more skip when read ahead buffer is activated.</li>

        this basically makes it faster...</li>
      <li>Added support for WinAmp style .pls playlist files including SHOUTcast. Titles for SHOUTcast servers are loaded from the
        .pls so you see all the neat stuff like the load of the servers when you load the playlist.</li>

      <li>Implements new pm123 decoder plug-in interface.</li>
      <li>Fixed floating point exception crashes. Let me know if you can still reproduce any SYS3183.</li>
      <li>Fixed problem with MP3 EQ range calculation with low frequency overflowing table and screwing up memory when MPEG 2.5
        Layer III files were played.</li>
      <li>Added support for virtual host names in HTTP123.DLL</li>
      <li>In HTTP123.DLL, fixed seeking (and also loading) problems and glitches, especially with slow media (like CD-ROMs) and big
        read buffers. But be wise, Read Ahead buffering produces an unnecessary overhead on fast media.</li>
      <li>Added mp3-&gt;wav decoder. Command line utility only for now.</li>
      <li>For developers, added a play status semaphore. It can be used to sleep instead of DosSleep() with the advantage of knowing
        exactly when the player stops.</li>
      <li>Fixed MMPM crash when DART underrun occurs.</li>
      <li>Fixed Equalizer mute crash.</li>
      <li>FileInfo (in playlist) was always reporting 0 length songs.</li>

        mpg123.</li>
      <li>Added new 10 bands ISO normal frequency equalizer for MP3s *only*. The interface (which also needs to be fixed) will not
        be updated until Taneli has more time on his hands, but here are the bands. Also note that the decibel calculation was wrong
        before (way too loud).</li>
      <li>12kHz MPEG 2.5 Layer 3 files now play.</li>
      <li>Added fix for new Xing encoded MP3s from mpg123 0.59q</li>
      <li>Added read ahead header check. This should make ALL valid MP3s even with broken headers work, and should not identify
        anything else than MPEG audio files as MPEG audio files such as bitmaps lying around in your MP3 directories.</li>
      <li>Added fix for Aurora from dink.</li>
      <li>oops, broke some MP3s for nothing, it's back all right now</li>
      <li>play 48 at 44 works right now</li>
      <li>found some Audio MPEG Header documentation. Should now work with any MP3s other players or decoders play, if not, please
        contact me. I've also fixed 8000Hz MP3 support, cool.</li>
      <li>patched possible divide by zero when loading corrupted files.</li>
      <li>implemented workaround for bad GUS driver DART buffer timing (it jumps by 250 ms step once in a while instead of
        incrementing for each buffer). Makes decoderPlayingSamples() work correctly on GUS.</li>
      <li>finally found the proper buffers to flush. no more first buffer trash kludge and now any snap crackle and pop are REALLY
        only coming from your sound card alone (check the visual plug-ins if you don't believe me)</li>
      <li>faster seek by boosting priority (oops, forgot this initially :)</li>
      <li>audio engine now fills empty buffers with 128 value instead of 0 for 8 bit playback (removes the clicks, but it still
        sounds like shit :).</li>

      <li>fixed timing bug between MP123_PLAY and MP123_STOP</li>
      <li>added buffer mode to HTTP123.DLL and in MPG123.DLL. rewinding and fast forward will give a quirk in buffer mode sometimes.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>decoderFileInfo can now be called more than once at the same time</li>
      <li>kludged the jump to command to trash the first buffer (until I figure out more on the digital audio processing and where
        it keeps the buffer)</li>
      <li>enlarged filename length from ~512 to ~1024, allows for bigger URL I guess.</li>
      <li>now compiled with VAC++, works better with DLLs than EMX</li>
      <li>RxDecoderError now works</li>
      <li>decoderError now reports non-critical errors</li>
      <li>decoderError now queues error messages, empty it, or you'll memory leak</li>
      <li>added filter plug-ins</li>
      <li>added possibility to change the decoder's band gain (there are only 32 linear bands, at the moment, this means at a sample
        rate of 44100, ~689Hz per band = 44100/2/32) they suck BTW</li>
      <li>added decoderPlayingSamples, to catch a few samples real time from the OS/2 DART audio system to display real time stuff
        like an oscilloscope or a spectrum analyzer. Note, it will get a buffer length in bytes, you have to calculate how many of
        them you need according to the bitspersample and channels.</li>
      <li>decoderFileInfo now reports 0 on success and some error code otherwise.</li>
      <li>decoderPlaying extension as decoderStatus</li>
      <li>new kludge that plays 48kHz PCM at 44.1kHz. This is really ugly, you don't hear a big difference, but you're better off
        converting it. If you are wondering why I'm not converting it real time 1. more CPU time needed *OR* 2. sounds real bad
        (aliasing and company)</li>
      <li>HTTP module now in HTTP.DLL</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>PM123 pre 1.0 Beta 2</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Added keyboard shortcuts:<br>
        * Left/Right = Rewind/Fast Forward<br>
        * Enter = Play/Stop<br>
        * 5 (on numeric keypad) = Pause<br>
        * Up/Down = Next/Previous song<br>
        * Alt F4 = Quit<br>
        * +/- = Increase/Decrease volume</li>
      <li>Added skin support</li>
      <li>Fixed shuffle</li>
      <li>Fixed RIFF headered and/or broken MP3 support</li>
      <li>Added seek slider (grab seek slider to move within MP3)</li>
      <li>Fixed control button errors</li>
      <li>Enhanced/fixed tag editor</li>
      <li>WarpAMP playlist loading</li>

    <ul>
      <li>decoderTime(PLAYEDSECS) now shows the position being played, not decoded.</li>
      <li>when buffers are trashed for rew and ffwd, the mpeg stream file position is brought to the file position that the decoder
        was at when it filled the currently playing audio buffer.</li>
      <li>the decoderTime(TOTALSECS) now reports something until all audio buffers are played.</li>
      <li>max buffers locked to 200 and min to 5. these are 16KB buffers, and they seem like absolute limits anyway.</li>
      <li>fix crash when there was an MCI error when starting playing and pm123 already played something before (trying to free
        memory it didn't allocate)</li>
      <li>the first buffer is trashed to prevent the playing of the last buffer of the previous stream (I can't figure out what's
        going on, help me!!!) Whatever snaps, crackles and pops left are due to your MPEG streams or your sound card.</li>
      <li>new decoderFileInfo(). allows program that need to check validity or specs of an mpeg stream with mpg123</li>
      <li>stop now unpauses the stream before closing.</li>
      <li>opening http streams should work better now.</li>
      <li>much better rewind and fast forward (makes jumptosecs work a lot better too)</li>
      <li>reporting errors should be more reliable</li>
      <li>http routines now report usable error messages</li>
      <li>http routines now check for "Content-Length" to determine total time</li>
      <li>seeking and timer routines now use the file position instead of keeping track of the frame numbers. makes the decoder
        faster and more consistent with the total time.</li>
      <li>added REXX support ... hum</li>
