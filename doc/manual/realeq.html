<h2>PM123's Real Equalizer</h2>
<p>The <b>Real Equalizer</b> plug-in provides a 1/3-octave equalizer and excellent
sound quality. The plug-in is provided with
PM123 and is located in file <tt>REALEQ.DLL</tt>.
You can display the configuration window by selecting the <em>Real Equalizer</em> item in the
Plug-ins sub menu of PM123's <a href="mainmenu.html">main menu</a>
or by pressing the <em>Configure</em> button in the <a href="properties.html">properties dialog</a>,
page Plug-ins 2/2.
</p><blockquote>

<p>The equalizer is complete controlled by this dialog.
  All changes are immediately applied to the sound processing engine.<br>
  Nevertheless it may take up to a few seconds for the changes to take effect,
  because there are already processed samples in the buffer of the output plug-in.

  <li><p>Check&nbsp;this box to <b>enable the RealEQ</b> operation.
    If it is unchecked all other settings have no effect and
    RealEQ does not consume CPU resources on playback.</p></li>
  <li><p>These are the <b>main control sliders</b>.
    They allow to adjust each frequency in a range of &plusmn;12dB.</p></li>
  <li><p>The mute check boxes can be used to exclude some frequencies from the spectrum.
    This can be useful for testing purposes.</p></li>
  <li><p>If you check <b>Lock Left/Right</b> all changes to the slides or mute check boxes
    are immediately reflected to the other channel.</p></li>
  <li><p>The <b>master controls</b> affect the whole channel.
    You might say this is redundant to the volume slider. It is not.
    Most sounds come in 16 bits resolution and are (nearly) normalized to 0dB FSR.
    This causes the sound to overdrive easily if one of the lower frequency sliders
    (up to about 200Hz) is significantly above zero.
    Take back the master volume of RealEQ in case of distortions and raise the volume
    of your speakers instead.</p></li>
  <li><p>Here you can switch between the <b>frequency spectrum</b> and the <b>group delay</b> view.
    The group delay is a completely independent set of sliders that introduce a frequency
    dependent delay into the sound. You can adjust the delay in the range of &plusmn; 12 milliseconds
    for each frequency. You may wonder that negative values are possible.
    Never fear, we don't break Einstein's rules. RealEQ simply prefetches some samples
    from the decoder plug-in before they are really played. Setting large group delays will
    degrade the frequency response of the equalizer at low frequencies and/or require a larger FIR order.<br>
    Negative group delays can be used to compensate for delays of resonances of vented enclosures,
    room resonances or passive speaker crossovers. If you don't know what I am talking about
    simply let all group delay sliders at zero.</p></li>
  <li><p>Here you can adjust the working precision of the equalizer engine.
    The FIR order controls the accuracy. And the FFT plan size controls the latency and the CPU usage.
    But the plan size must always be significantly larger than the FIR order.
    Reasonable values are:
