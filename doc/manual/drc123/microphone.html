    <h2>Measurement Microphone for PM123</h2>
    <p>While the properties of the sound card can be compensated by a
      calibration, the properties of the microphone and the microphone
      amplifier can not. They directly cause wrong results and bad sound.
    </p>
    <h3>Required properties</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Linear frequency response</b><br>
        Any sound modification introduced by the microphone will be compensated
        by DRC123. But there is no such thing to compensate for in playback
        mode. So if your microphone cannot record a certain frequency it will
        be amplified until your microphone can recognize it - a very bad idea.</li>
      <li><b>Omnidirectional characteristics</b><br>
        Your microphones response should not depend on the direction of the
        sound. While this sounds complicated it makes things rather cheaper
        than mor expensive.</li>
      <li><b>Sensitivity</b><br>
        Since your speakers are not close to the microphone it should have
        enough sensitivity to get a reasonable output.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><a name="types"></a>Mircophone types</h3>
    <p><em>Electret microphones</em> are the very first choice for this
      purpose. They
      are cheap, omnidirectional and have rather high sensitivity. </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Analog measurement microphones</b></dt>
      <dd>Analog microphones like Bayerdynamic <em>MM-1</em> (also sold as
        t.bone) are <em>usable and sufficient</em>. However, you need a <a href="#amp">microphone
          amplifier</a> with <em>phantom powering</em>
        to connect it to your sound card. A small mixer is the cheapest way to
        get them working. But be sure not to have any filtering activated. </dd>
      <dt><b>Raw electret capsules</b></dt>
      <dd>Raw electret cartridges without any case are a <em>good choice</em>
        as well. They are small and do not modify the sound field very much.
        this causes usually a reasonable good frequency response. You still
        need a <a href="#amp">microphone amplifier</a>, this time with bias
        power.<br>
        But you should not chose any electret cartridge. Some of them are
        really bad. But there are types that are explicitly designed for
        measurement purposes. Panasonic <em>WM61A</em> is well known to fit
        the needs. Similar models are also sold as Monacor <em>MCE 2500</em>.</dd>
      <dt><b>USB measurement microphones</b></dt>
      <dd> Digital USB microphones like Behringer ECM8000 are <strong>not
          usable</strong>.
        The reason is that their internal ADC has small frequency tolerances.
        DRC123 needs to suppress ambient noise to a very high degree. This is
        achieved by using frequency windows with a width of down to 10<small><sup>-6</sup></small>
        (1 ppm) and less. No sound device will fit this need. You need the <i>same</i>
        sound device for recording and playback for the tolerances to cancel.
        The result will
        look like
        this <a href="calibration.html#nomasterclock">example</a>.</dd>
      <dt><b>USB measurement microphones with integrated line out </b></dt>
      <dd>Unlike the stand alone USB microphones the ones with a built-in
        sound output device <strong>perfectly fit the needs</strong>. The hack
        is that the ADC and the DAC share the same crystal oscillator. So the
        frequency tolerances cancel in the same way as they do with an ordinary
        sound card. The difficult task is to get a sound driver for OS/2. </dd>

    <h3><a name="amp"></a>Microphone amplifier
    </h3>
    <p>First of all the amplifier <em>must match your microphone type</em>.
      Especially because <a href="http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/microphone_powering.html">electret
microphones
        need powering</a>.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Using the sound cards integrated amplifier</b></dt>
      <dd>Some sound devices have built in microphone amplifiers. Although
        it is obvious to use them unfortunately their <strong>quality</strong>
        is mostly very <strong>poor</strong>. Furthermore there are different
        and incompatible concepts for microphone powering. </dd>
