    <h2>Reference signals for DRC123 measurements
    </h2>
    <p>DRC123 uses a special kind of reference signal to get optimal
      results. The reference has the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The signal has approximately the energy distribution of <em>white
          noise</em>, but</li>
      <li>the <em>spectrum is <a href="#discrete">discrete</a></em> to
        get a better signal to
        noise ratio.</li>
      <li>The reference contains only energy in the <em>frequency interval
          [20 Hz, 20 kHz]</em>.</li>
      <li>Optionally all frequencies are odd multiples of some base frequency to
        reduce <a href="#distortion">intermodulation noise</a>.</li>
      <li>In stereo mode the left and right channel use distinct
        frequencies.</li>
      <li>In differential output mode channel 2 is inverted. Special
        hardware can use this to eliminate common mode noise. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How does it work?
    </h3>
    <p>The reference generator uses <em>Inverse Fourier Transform</em> to
      synthesize
      the output. The Fourier Coefficients are calculated as follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td colspan="1" rowspan="2" valign="middle"><var>magnitude<small><sub>i</sub></small></var>
              =</td>
            <td colspan="1" rowspan="2" valign="middle"><font size="+3">{</font></td>
            <td> <br>
            </td>
            <td valign="middle">&nbsp;0,</td>
            <td> <br>
            </td>
            <td valign="middle">if <var>f</var> &#8713; [20, 20000] &#8744; <var>i</var>
              is even and option is enabled</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td valign="middle"><var>&nbsp;f</var><sup>-0.2</sup>, </td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td valign="middle">if <var>f</var> &#8712; [20, 20000] &#8743; <var>i</var>
              is odd or option is disabled</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p><var>phase<small><sub>i</sub></small></var> = random()</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In stereo mode additionally every second nonzero magnitude is set to
      zero alternating for the left and the right channel. So in fact the two
      channels are measured at slightly different frequencies.</p>
    <p>The result from the Inverse Fourier Transform is <em>normalized</em>
      and then played in an infinite loop until the measurement is stopped.</p>
    <h3><a name="discrete"></a>Random noise with discrete spectrum?</h3>
    <p><i>How can a random noise have a discrete spectrum? And why is it
        that important?</i></p>
    <p>Well, the amount of entropy in the reference signal is limited,
      because the reference is played in a loop. Every repetitive signal has
      a discrete spectrum, that only contains frequencies that are multiples
      of the repetition rate. For the measurement this is important, because
      not only one cycle of the signal is recorded. In fact every <var>N</var>-th
sample
      of the recording is added before any further processing, with <var>N</var>
      = FFT length = length until the reference repeats itself (about 2
      seconds). This causes any frequency of the recording that does not fit
      in the reference loop length to be canceled sooner or later. The
      addition of samples with the same period than the reference length
      effectively performs a comb filter.</p>
    <p>For this to work it is essential, that the phase of the reference
      playback and the recording is synchronized exactly. In fact the
      coherence length must exceed the entire measurement. Because of
      tolerances and phase noise there is only one option to satisfy this
      condition: <strong>playback and recording must be done by the same
        physical sound device</strong>, controlled by the same crystal
      oscillator respectively.</p>
    <h3><a name="distortion"></a>What about nonlinearities?</h3>
    <p><i>Most transfer systems have more or less nonlinearity. Does this
        impact the measurement?</i></p>
    <p>Yes and no. Nonlinearities basically introduce harmonics and
      intermodulation. In the second order (H2) this causes new frequencies
      to appear that are sums and differences of two other frequencies.<br>
      If the reference contains only frequencies that are <i>odd</i> multiples
      of some base frequency (the repetition rate), whatever you do, if you
      add or subtract two of them you will always get an <i>even</i>
      multiple. This frequencies are unused and do not impact the measurement.</p>
    <p>However, nonlinearities may also produce intermodulation terms of <i>three</i>
      frequencies in the signal (i.e. H3). These artifacts will collide with
      other measurement data. But have a look at the logarithmic scale. If
      you add some noise at -30 dB or less you will not even notice a change.
      So in conclusion, the 3rd order distortions will only give any notable
      impact if their intensity is in the order of the dynamic range of your
      transfer function to measure. This is unlikely for room responses,
      since -30 dB is almost silence and you cannot compensate for a loss of
      this amount anyway.</p>
